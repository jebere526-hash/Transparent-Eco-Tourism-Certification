# 🌿 Transparent Eco-Tourism Certification

Welcome to a decentralized solution for certifying eco-friendly tourism practices using the Stacks blockchain! This project ensures transparency and trust by allowing tourism businesses to register, certify, and showcase their sustainable practices while enabling travelers to verify their eco-credentials.

## ✨ Features

🔐 Register tourism businesses with unique identifiers  
✅ Certify eco-friendly practices through third-party auditors  
📊 Track and update sustainability metrics (e.g., carbon footprint, waste reduction)  
🌍 Publicly query certifications for transparency  
🗳️ Community-driven reviews and ratings for certified businesses  
🔄 Revoke or renew certifications based on compliance  
📈 Incentivize green practices with tokenized rewards  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Tourism Businesses**  
- Register your business with a unique ID and details (name, location, description).  
- Submit sustainability metrics (e.g., energy usage, waste management) via `submit-metrics`.  
- Request certification from approved auditors using `request-certification`.  
- Receive tokenized rewards for maintaining eco-standards via `claim-rewards`.  

**For Auditors**  
- Verify submitted metrics and issue certifications using `issue-certification`.  
- Revoke certifications for non-compliance with `revoke-certification`.  

**For Travelers**  
- Query business certifications using `get-certification-details`.  
- Submit reviews and ratings for certified businesses via `submit-review`.  

**For Everyone**  
- View all certified businesses and their sustainability metrics transparently with `list-certified-businesses`.  

## 🛡️ Security & Transparency

- **Immutable Records**: Certifications and metrics are stored on-chain for transparency.  
- **Auditor Accountability**: Only approved auditors can issue/revoke certifications.  
- **Community Trust**: Public reviews and ratings ensure accountability.  
- **Incentives**: Tokenized rewards encourage sustained eco-friendly practices.  

## 🌟 Why This Matters

This system combats greenwashing by providing verifiable proof of eco-friendly practices. Travelers can trust certifications, businesses are incentivized to stay green, and auditors ensure integrity—all powered by the Stacks blockchain!
